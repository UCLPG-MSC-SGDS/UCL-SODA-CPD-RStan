We will use the two functions shape2mat() and prep_icar_data() to create the adjacency matrix as nodes and edges. tidybayes: grants access to further functions for managing posterior estimates. We will need it calculating the exceedance probabilities. Note that is loaded alongside tidyverse and dplyr packages. bayesplot: grants access to further functions for plot posterior estimates from Bayesian models. loo: this package allows the user to perform model validation and comparison tidyverse: grants access to ‘streamlined’ codes and functions for simplified data management in R beyond those provided with Base R codes. dplyr: grants further access to more ‘streamlined’ codes and functions for simplified data management in R beyond those provided with Base R codes. install.packages(&quot;sf&quot;) install.packages(&quot;tmap&quot;) install.packages(&quot;Stars&quot;) install.packages(&quot;SpatialEpi&quot;) install.packages(&quot;geostan&quot;) install.packages(&quot;tidybayes&quot;) install.packages(&quot;bayesplot&quot;) install.packages(&quot;loo&quot;) install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;) This concludes the installation section and sets you computer up for the course, if you encounter any problems please contact me. "],["introduction-to-stan-programming.html", "2 Introduction to Stan Programming 2.1 Introduction 2.2 About Stan Programming 2.3 Tasks", " 2 Introduction to Stan Programming 2.1 Introduction 2.1.1 Lectures (Length: 1:55:55 minutes) [Watch on YouTube] 2.1.2 Learning outcomes Today’s session aims to introduce you to the basic Stan programming etiquette for Bayesian analysis in RStudio using Stan as an Interface, and producing output and interpreting it’s results. By the end of this session, you should be able to perform the following: Getting acquainted with Stan and learning the basic programming etiquette of Stan - this will include simulating and estimation of parameters. Know how to write and compile various probability distributions for simple parameters (i.e., mean, standard deviation, a proportion etc.,) in Stan. Know how to compile the results into RStudio for use, interpretation and visualisation. After the demonstration session is delivered in the first 1-hour of the practical - you can use the computer practical session to try the tutorials yourself by following the instructions as well as trying out the tasks. 2.1.3 Demonstration (Length: 1:08:38 minutes) [Watch on YouTube] 2.1.4 Setting up the work directory Since, this is our first practical lesson for Day 1, let us create a new folder CPD-course at the desktop location of our computer. Now, create a sub folder called “Day 1” within the CPD-course folder. Here, we will store all our R and Stan scripts. Set the work directory to the Day 1 folder. Download the dataset for today and move them into the Day 1 folder: Bti_Larvicide_dataset.csv For Windows, the code for setting the work directory will be: setwd(&quot;C:/Users/AccountName/Desktop/CPD-course/Day 1&quot;) For MAC, the code for setting the work directory will be: setwd(&quot;/Users/AccountName/Desktop/CPD-course/Day 1&quot;) 2.1.5 Loading packages To start writing scripts for Bayesian analysis, we will need to load the rstan package. # Load the packages with library() library(&#39;rstan&#39;) Note that when you load rstan from cran, you will see some recommendations on using multiple cores for speeding the process. For the best experience, we highly recommend using this code: options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores()) rstan_options(auto_write = TRUE) This tells RStudio to use multiple core for parallel processing whenever Stan is being implemented. Every time you want to use Stan - make sure to load parallel::detectCores() and rstan_options code. 2.2 About Stan Programming This section describes how to code up a basic Stan model. This section forms the foundation for later, and more complex models. 2.2.1 Basic building blocks I: Opening a Stan Script in RStudio Alright, let’s open a Stan file. You can do this by clicking and selecting File &gt; New File &gt; Stan File When you open a new Stan file, you will be greeted with an untitled script which contains the following bits of code: // // This Stan program defines a simple model, with a // vector of values &#39;y&#39; modeled as normally distributed // with mean &#39;mu&#39; and standard deviation &#39;sigma&#39;. // // Learn more about model development with Stan at: // // http://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan.html // https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started // // The input data is a vector &#39;y&#39; of length &#39;N&#39;. data { int&lt;lower=0&gt; N; vector[N] y; } // The parameters accepted by the model. Our model // accepts two parameters &#39;mu&#39; and &#39;sigma&#39;. parameters { real mu; real&lt;lower=0&gt; sigma; } // The model to be estimated. We model the output // &#39;y&#39; to be normally distributed with mean &#39;mu&#39; // and standard deviation &#39;sigma&#39;. model { y ~ normal(mu, sigma); } Do not worry about that - it is just some formalities put there by default by the developers behind rstan. You can delete everything you see in this script as we will build our own basic script from scratch. Once you have deleted the default information save the empty file in the Day 1 folder naming it Predicting_larvicide_concentrations.stan. Whenever you are saving Stan programme in RStudio always make sure to save it with a .stan ending. 2.2.2 Basic building blocks II: Structure of a Stan script A typical Stan script consist of the following 6 blocks: Data Transformed data Parameters Transformed parameters Model Generated quantities Out of these 6 blocks, the Data, Parameters and Model block must be specified in your Stan script. These are three compulsory blocks needed in any Stan script in order for a Bayesian model to work within the rstan environment. Let us define what these three important blocks are. FIRST: The data block allows the user to declare how the model reads the dataset from RStudio by specifying the sample size N or observations; the number of k parameters that needs to be estimated; the names or list of independent variables for the corresponding parameters (e.g., coefficients); the dependent variable (or outcome); as well as any constraints that needs to be applied to the dataset. A data block is specified accordingly in the script as: data { } It is within these curly brackets will specify these details of our dataset. They must be precise as it will have to correspond with the dataset that’s currently loaded in RStudio’s memory. SECOND: The parameters block allows the user to declare all the unknown quantities we are going to estimate. The parameters that go here are the ones we want to infer or predict. It define includes the name(s) of the parameters that correspond things like the mean, variance, sd, coefficients or anything that you are going to estimate. A parameters block is specified after the data block: data { } parameters { } THIRD: The model block allows the user to declare and specify the sampling statistical statements for the dependent variable (i.e., likelihood function) as well as any priors for the parameters we will estimate through the model. This block is where we code our probability distributions. A model block is specified after the parameters block: data { } parameters { } model { } Note that adding a double forward slashes // lets the user add a comment to the script. Let us add some comments into each of the blocks: // Add comments after double forward slashes data { // data block } parameters { // parameters block } model { // model block } Important Notes: Since, the other blocks are not compulsory - we will leave them out for now. But we will come back and explain what those remaining blocks are in Day 2 and 3. Now, save your Stan script. 2.2.3 Basic building blocks III: Data types and constraint declarations In Stan, all parameters and data must be defined as variables with a specific type. Note, this is quite a pain but going through this step allows rstan to perform really fast. There are four basic data types: int: for integers, used for specifying the sample size, and is applied to discrete variables real: for continuous, is applied to continuous variables (i.e., ratio or interval) array: for a containing several elements of data points that are real or int values vector: for a containing several elements of data points that are real or int values. It is similar to array syntax, but if you are going to perform algebraic manipulation of several elements with matrices - then it is best to use them as a vector. matrix: for containing a collection of several column vectors as a single n-by-m object. For constraints, we specify them on variables. For example, if we are dealing with a proportion p we will code it as real&lt;lower=0, upper=1&gt; p to tell Stan that p can be any value from 0 to 1, inclusive. Note that specifying constraints really helps speed Stan up so use them wherever you can. Lastly, you can create array of variables. For example, array[10] real&lt;lower=0 upper=1&gt; p tells Stan that p is an array of 10 real values for proportions. We can also create a matrix to represent a set of independent variables and so on. Please take you time with learning these codes, and experiment with them more to gain proficiency. Now that we have discussed these points - let us work with an actual demonstration to show data types and constraints work. 2.2.4 Basic building blocks IV: Developing our model PROBLEM: To combat mosquito populations - water bodies are treated with biological an agent called Bti dunks. These are ringed shaped objects that dissolve in standing water where mosquitoes breed. 120 samples from various points to ensure its working against mosquitoes and its not a cause for concern in terms of environmental contamination. What is the mean &amp; standard deviation, and uncertainty surrounding the levels of Bti larvicide concentrations present in standing water? If you open the following dataset Bti_Larvicide_dataset.csv: # open dataset Bti_data &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Bti_Larvicide_dataset.csv&quot;) # open data viewer View(Bti_data) You will notice that it contains 120 observations, and 2 columns: The first column standing_water_id is the unique ID number for each observation The second column Bti_mgl is the concentrations of Bti larvicides in various water bodies (in mg/L) Let us build our first model that predicts the mean and standard deviation as a posterior distribution. Let us extract the bits and pieces of information for the data block: Total sample size is 120. We will define that as N in the Stan as an integer int with non-zero values in the data block The column in the data frame for Bti_data (i.e., Bti_mgl) needs to be extracted. We will define that as an array of size N containing real values. We will name the variable as bti in Stan within the data block Now that we have the information, in RStudio, we will need to build this dataset into a list object using list() to connect it with the data block in the Stan script. Let us store the data in list object called stan_dataset: # create a list object using the list() function stan_dataset &lt;- list(N = 120, bti = Bti_data$Bti_mgl) # print data in console stan_dataset Now that the list object is prepared, we can start scripting in Stan. FIRST: We specify the total number of samples as N that its an integer int which cannot be negative a number &lt;lower = 0&gt; in the data block. Also, we also need to specify name of the bti variable in stan that its an array of size N consisting real numbers in the data block too. data { // define N (120) int&lt;lower = 0&gt; N; // create an array of size 120 to store BTI values array[N] real bti; } SECOND: For the parameters block, here we will need to specify the name of the parameters that we want to infer. Here, its \\(\\mu\\) which is the mean levels of Bti concentrations, as well as \\(\\sigma\\) which is the standard deviation. Note that, we need to tell Stan that these parameters are real numbers, as well as they are strictly positive values (i.e., use &lt;lower = 0&gt; to apply constraint) because we cannot have negative concentrations &amp; a negative value for standard deviation. data { // define N (120) int&lt;lower = 0&gt; N; // create an array of size 120 to store BTI values array[N] real bti; } parameters { // defined the mean as mu real&lt;lower = 0&gt; mu; // defined the SD as sigma real&lt;lower = 0&gt; sigma; } THIRD: For the model block, we need to state that both \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) in the likelihood function - hence, bti variable will be sampled from the normal distribution. The model block will be: data { // define N (120) int&lt;lower = 0&gt; N; // create an array of size 120 to store BTI values array[N] real bti; } parameters { // defined the mean as mu real&lt;lower = 0&gt; mu; // defined the SD as sigma real&lt;lower = 0&gt; sigma; } model { // likelihood function, without any prior distribution specified bti ~ normal(mu, sigma); } COMPLIMENTS: Well done, we have built our first Bayesian model in Stan. Let us now save this script. What we need to do next is compile this script in RStudio to get our results. 2.2.5 Basic building blocks V: Compiling Stan code in RStudio You can use the stan() function to call the stan script from RStudio in order to obtain the posterior estimates. The results will be stored in stan object called bti_prediction: # the directory needs to be set to where you save the dataset and Stan script bti_prediction &lt;- stan(&quot;Predicting_larvicide_concentrations.stan&quot;, data=stan_dataset, iter=3000, chains=3, verbose = FALSE) Some notes on the above code’s arguments: data= specify the dataset stored as a list object. iter= we are asking the stan() to perform 3,000 iterations on each chain to generate the posterior samples. The algorithm behind these iterations can be MCMC, NUTS or HMC algorithm (NUTS No-U-turn sampler is the default) chains= we are asking the stan() function to perform 3 chains using 3 cores in our computer The resulting output can be printed with the function print(). Here, we are going to print the mean, standard error in mean, SD and the IQR ranges with 95% limits (i.e., 2.5% and 97.5%): print(bti_prediction, probs=c(0.025, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.975)) We obtain this summary table: Inference for Stan model: anon_model. 3 chains, each with iter=3000; warmup=1500; thin=1; post-warmup draws per chain=1500, total post-warmup draws=4500. mean se_mean sd 2.5% 25% 50% 75% 97.5% n_eff Rhat mu 25.27 0.01 0.45 24.39 24.96 25.26 25.57 26.18 3624 1 sigma 5.01 0.01 0.34 4.40 4.77 4.99 5.22 5.72 3811 1 lp__ -247.60 0.02 1.03 -250.35 -247.97 -247.28 -246.87 -246.61 2164 1 Samples were drawn using NUTS(diag_e) at Mon Jun 9 01:10:46 2025. For each parameter, n_eff is a crude measure of effective sample size, and Rhat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat=1). What does it all mean? The top part states that 3 chains were run for 3000 iterations. However, the first 1500 samples generated from each chain were discarded as warm-up, meaning that only 1500 samples from each chain were kept, resulting 4500 (1500x3) total post-warm-up sample draws. The output shows the summary statistics for our \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\). The lp__ is the log-probability - which is used to quantify how well the model is for the data but, in my opinion, its not a useful estimate. Instead, use the effective sample size n_eff and Rhat. If the Rhat is less than 1.05 for all parameters - it means that the estimation of our parameters are fine. Anything above 1.05 it means that the results are not reliable. 2.2.6 Basic building blocks VI: Extract posterior samples &amp; interpretation At this point, let us extract the posterior samples for the mean and standard deviation, and graph them to understand it posterior distribution. We use the extract() function from the rstan package, and graph them: # extracting the samples (it should be 4500) extracted_samples &lt;- rstan::extract(bti_prediction) The object extracted_samples should contain the 4,500 sample results each for the Bti (mg/L) mean and its corresponding SD. From the extraction, suppose if you wanted to compute the posterior mean, with the 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles (these limits are referred to as 95% credibility limits (95% CrI)). This can be done using both the mean() and quantile() function. Here is how we compute them: # posterior mean for mu mean(extracted_samples$mu) # calculate 95% Credibility limits (95% CrI) for mu quantile(extracted_samples$mu, probs = c(0.025, 0.975)) We can also examine the posterior samples as a distribution as a visual through a density plot: # generate probability density plot of the posterior samples plot(density(extracted_samples$mu), main = &quot;Posterior samples&quot;, xlab = &quot;Posterior Means for Bti concentrations (mg/L)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Posterior Probability Density (Plausibility)&quot;) # Add vertical dashed line at the mean abline(v = 25.24285, lty = &quot;dashed&quot;, col = &quot;darkgrey&quot;, lwd = 2) # add vertical line for the lower 95% CrI value abline(v = 24.34943, lty = &quot;dashed&quot;, col = &quot;darkgrey&quot;, lwd = 2) # add vertical line for the upper 95% CrI value abline(v = 26.12595, lty = &quot;dashed&quot;, col = &quot;darkgrey&quot;, lwd = 2) We can also report the results for the standard deviation as well (i.e., its posterior mean, 95% CrI and posterior distribution): # posterior mean for sigma mean(extracted_samples$sigma) # calculate 95% Credibility limits (95% CrI) for sigma quantile(extracted_samples$sigma, probs = c(0.025, 0.975)) # generate probability density plot of the posterior samples for sigma plot(density(extracted_samples$sigma), main = &quot;Posterior samples&quot;, xlab = &quot;Posterior Means for Standard Deviation&quot;, ylab = &quot;Posterior Probability Density (Plausibility)&quot;) # Add vertical dashed line at the mean abline(v = 4.998751, lty = &quot;dashed&quot;, col = &quot;darkgrey&quot;, lwd = 2) # add vertical line for the lower 95% CrI value abline(v = 4.411431, lty = &quot;dashed&quot;, col = &quot;darkgrey&quot;, lwd = 2) # add vertical line for the upper 95% CrI value abline(v = 5.666914, lty = &quot;dashed&quot;, col = &quot;darkgrey&quot;, lwd = 2) Interpretation: The estimated mean (\\(\\mu\\)) of Bti concentrations from our sample posterior distribution was 25.24 mg/L (i.e., most likely or plausible value) with 95% credibility limits of 24.39 and 26.12. Formally writing as \\(\\mu\\) = 25.24 mg/L (95% CrI: 24.39-26.12). In terms of the spread, the estimated standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) is 4.99 mg/L (95% CrI: 4.411 to 5.666) 2.3 Tasks 2.3.1 Task 1 - Simulating and Estimating Body Mass Index (BMI) Try this first problem in Stan: You are tasked to simulate a sample of 1000 BMI values from a Normal distribution with mean 23 and SD 8.3. Then, using Stan, fit a Bayesian model to estimate the unknown population mean BMI and its 95% credible interval. Assume both the population mean (\\(\\mu\\)) and standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) are unknown. Hints: In the R script, use the function rnorm() to generate your sample of 1000 BMI points In the R script, create a list() with N and bmi (your simulated data) In the Stan script for the following: Define the data block in accordance with the list object. Use a parameters block to define mu and sigma as real values (constrain sigma to be positive). Use a model block to write the likelihood: bmi ~ normal(mu, sigma); Report the posterior mean of BMI and its 95% credible interval from the model output. Generate its posterior density plot. 2.3.2 Task 2 - Low-level arsenic poisoning in Cornwall, UK Try this second problem in Stan: Suppose a random sample of 50 villagers from a rural community in Cornwall, UK, were surveyed for signs of chronic arsenic exposure. Each person was classified as either Diseased or Healthy. Out of the 50 surveyed, 19 were found to be diseased. Use a Bayesian model to estimate the true prevalence of arsenic poisoning in the wider population. Hints: In the R script, create a list() with N and Diseased. In the Stan script for the following: Define the data block in accordance with the list object. Use a parameters block to define prevalence as a parameter (constrain prevalence between 0 and 1). Use a model block to write the likelihood: Diseased ~ binomial(N, prevalence); Report the posterior mean of the prevalence of metallic poisoning in Cornwall with its 95% credible interval from the model output. Generate its posterior density plot.

Every time you want to use Stan - make sure to load parallel::detectCores() and rstan_options code. 3.2 Input: Data, Process Model and Assumptions for Priors This section describes how to code up a basic Stan model from scratch. Here, we will use an example of a mechanistic model for predicting incident disease outcome. This section forms the foundation for later, and more complex models. PROBLEM: Bayesian estimation of Epidemic Growth for Aedes-borne Infections -During the early days of heavy rainfall - there is a huge influx of mosquito populations in Recife which causes an outbreak Dengue virus. Public health officials collected daily case counts over the course of 15 days during this period where rainfalls are pronounced. The process model for predicting dengue is: \\(D(t) = D_0 \\exp(rt)\\) What is the initial value of dengue cases \\(D_0\\) as an incidence? Note that \\(D(t)\\) is the observed number of cases at time (\\(t\\)) What is the estimated epidemic growth rate \\(r\\)? Enter the following dataset: # Simulated data day &lt;- 0:14 observed_cases &lt;- c(12, 9, 19, 30, 27, 45, 67, 71, 103, 119, 161, 213, 288, 340, 431) Let us extract the bits and pieces of information for the data block: Total sample size is 15 which corresponds to the number of time points starting from 0 to 14. We will define that as N in the Stan as an integer int with non-zero values in the data block We are going to read each day point separately from 0 to 14. We will define that as t in the Stan as an array of size N to hold the collection of values. These are non-zero values in the data block The array for observed_cases needs to be extracted. We will define that as an array of size N containing int values. We will name the variable as y in Stan within the data block Now that we have the information, in RStudio, we will need to build this dataset into a list object using list() to connect it with the data block in the Stan script. Let us store the data in list object called stan_dataset: # create a list object using the list() function # Data list for Stan stan_dataset &lt;- list(N = length(day), t = as.vector(day), y = as.integer(observed_cases) ) # print data in console stan_dataset Now that the list object is prepared, we can start scripting in Stan. FIRST: We specify the total number of samples as N that its an integer int which cannot be negative a number &lt;lower = 0&gt; in the data block. Also, we also need to specify name of the t and y variables in stan that its an array of size N consisting of positive int numbers in the data block too. data { int&lt;lower = 0&gt; N; array[N] int&lt;lower = 0&gt; t; array[N] int&lt;lower = 0&gt; y; } SECOND: For the parameters block, here we will need to specify the name of the parameters that we want to infer. Here, its \\(D_0\\) which is the mean initial (or baseline) cases of Dengue, as well as \\(r\\) which is the mean growth rate for the epidemic. Note that, we need to tell Stan that these parameters real numbers, where the former is strictly positive values (i.e., use &lt;lower = 0&gt; to apply constraint), and \\(r\\) can be either negative or positive. data { int&lt;lower = 0&gt; N; array[N] int&lt;lower = 0&gt; t; array[N] int&lt;lower = 0&gt; y; } parameters { real&lt;lower = 0&gt; D0; real r; } THIRD: For the model block, we need to create mechanistic model for the \\(D(t)\\). Howeever, we are going to state some priors as follows: Prior assumptions: \\(D_0\\) could be anything, but it is mostly likely 10, and probably between 1 to 20, anything higher is less likely. This corresponds to a gamma distribution i.e., \\(D_0\\) ~ gamma(2, 0.1), which is a weakly informative prior \\(r\\) could be anything, it is hard to say – therefore I will be cautious and assume that it is negligible (0); however, the growth rate could be an increasing, or a decreasing value, and so I will assume a SD of 1. This corresponds to a normal distribution i.e., \\(r\\) ~ normal(0, 1), hence, its Non-informative prior Likelihood function for process model - The best suited likelihood function for the process model is a Poisson. Why? Because the observed data i.e., observed_cases is discrete and not continuous. Here is what the Stan code will look like: data { int&lt;lower = 0&gt; N; array[N] int&lt;lower = 0&gt; t; array[N] int&lt;lower = 0&gt; y; } parameters { real&lt;lower = 0&gt; D0; real r; } model { // priors D0 ~ gamma(2, 0.1); r ~ normal(0, 1); for (n in 1:N) { real lambda = D0 * exp(r * t[n]); y[n] ~ poisson(lambda); } } Lastly, we will add one more block called the generated quantities block to make predictions about the incidence by generating simulated data that resembles the original. data { int&lt;lower = 0&gt; N; array[N] int&lt;lower = 0&gt; t; array[N] int&lt;lower = 0&gt; y; } parameters { real&lt;lower = 0&gt; D0; real r; } model { D0 ~ gamma(2, 0.1); r ~ normal(0, 1); for (n in 1:N) { real lambda = D0 * exp(r * t[n]); y[n] ~ poisson(lambda); } } generated quantities { vector[N] y_pred; for (n in 1:N) { y_pred[n] = poisson_rng(D0 * exp(r * t[n])); } } COMPLIMENTS: Well done, we have built our second Bayesian model in Stan. Let us now save this script. What we need to do next is compile this script in RStudio to get our results. 3.3 Compiling Stan code in RStudio You can use the stan() function to call the stan script from RStudio in order to obtain the posterior estimates. The results will be stored in stan object called bti_prediction: fit &lt;- stan( file = &quot;Incidence_rates.stan&quot;, data = stan_dataset, iter = 3000, chains = 3, verbose = FALSE ) Recall that the above code’s arguments are as follows: data= specify the dataset stored as a list object. iter= we are asking the stan() to perform 3,000 iterations on each chain to generate the posterior samples. The algorithm behind these iterations can be MCMC, NUTS or HMC algorithm (NUTS No-U-turn sampler is the default) chains= we are asking the stan() function to perform 3 chains using 3 cores in our computer The resulting output can be printed with the function print(). Here, we are going to print the mean, standard error in mean, SD and the IQR ranges with 95% limits (i.e., 2.5% and 97.5%): print(fit, pars = c(&quot;D0&quot;, &quot;r&quot;), probs = c(0.025, 0.5, 0.975)) We obtain this summary table: Inference for Stan model: anon_model. 3 chains, each with iter=3000; warmup=1500; thin=1; post-warmup draws per chain=1500, total post-warmup draws=4500. mean se_mean sd 2.5% 50% 97.5% n_eff Rhat D0 12.31 0.04 1.06 10.31 12.26 14.51 771 1 r 0.26 0.00 0.01 0.24 0.26 0.27 784 1 Samples were drawn using NUTS(diag_e) at Tue Jun 10 08:37:14 2025. For each parameter, n_eff is a crude measure of effective sample size, and Rhat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat=1). What does it all mean? The top part states that 3 chains were run for 3000 iterations. However, the first 1500 samples generated from each chain were discarded as warm-up, meaning that only 1500 samples from each chain were kept, resulting 4500 (1500x3) total post-warm-up sample draws. The output shows the summary statistics for our \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\). The lp__ is the log-probability - which is used to quantify how well the model is for the data but, in my opinion, its not a useful estimate. Instead, use the effective sample size n_eff and Rhat. If the Rhat is less than 1.05 for all parameters - it means that the estimation of our parameters are fine. Anything above 1.05 it means that the results are not reliable. Interpretation: The estimated growth rate for incident Dengue 0.26 (95% CrI: 0.24 to 0.27). The estimated mean value for \\(D_0\\) was 12.31 (95% CrI: 10.31 to 14.51) At this point, let us extract the posterior samples for the mean and standard deviation, and graph them to understand it posterior distribution. We can also see if the predictions are similar to original data. # extracting the samples (it should be 4500) # Extract and plot posterior predictions posterior &lt;- extract(fit) y_pred_mean &lt;- apply(posterior$y_pred, 2, mean) Here is the plot: # plot observed vs predictions plot(day, observed_cases, pch = 16, col = &quot;red&quot;, xlab = &quot;Day&quot;, ylab = &quot;Cases&quot;, main = &quot;Observed vs. Posterior Predicted Cases&quot;) # add cosmetics to plot lines(day, y_pred_mean, col = &quot;blue&quot;, lwd = 2) legend(&quot;topleft&quot;, legend = c(&quot;Observed&quot;, &quot;Predicted Mean&quot;), col = c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;), pch = c(16, NA), lty = c(NA, 1)) You may be interested in seeing the simulated samples that was drawn from the joint distribution. You can pull this information and store as a data frame: posterior_df &lt;- data.frame( D0 = posterior$D0, r = posterior$r, predictions = posterior$y_pred ) 3.4 Tasks 3.4.1 Task 1 - Aedes-borne infestation in Recife 05/2023 Try this second problem in Stan: Suppose a random sample of 976 households from Recife, Brazil, were surveyed Aedes-borne infestation. From the total, 428 were affected by mosquito infestation. It is common knowledge that prevalence of infestation is rough about 20-25%. Use a Bayesian model to estimate the true prevalence of infestation in Recife. Hints: In the R script, create a list() with N and Infested. In the Stan script for the following: Define the data block in accordance with the list object. Use a parameters block to define prevalence as a parameter (constrain prevalence between 0 and 1). Use a model block to write the likelihood: Infested ~ binomial(N, prevalence); In the model block, use it to specify the appropriate prior distribution for the prevalence parameter. Report the posterior mean of the prevalence of infestation in Recife with its associated 95% credibility interval from the model output. Generate its posterior density plot.

The data used in today’s practical is an anonymised resampled excerpt from the Development Frontiers in Crime, Livelihoods and Urban Poverty in Nigeria (FCLP) project that aimed to provide an alternative framework for understanding the specific drivers of criminality in a West African urban context. This research project used a mixed-methods approach for combining statistical modeling, geovisualisation and ethnography, and attempted to situate insecurity and crime against a broader backdrop of rapid urban growth, seasonal migration, youth unemployment and informality. The study typically provided researchers both in Nigeria and internationally a richer and more nuanced evidence base on the particular dynamics of crime from an African perspective resulting a number of publications: [1], [2] and [3]. We will reproduce some of the analysis using a Bayesian regression model. 4.1.6 Loading and installing packages We will need to load the following packages: # Load the packages with library() library(&#39;rstan&#39;) library(&quot;loo&quot;) library(&quot;MASS&quot;) For the best experience with rstan, we highly recommend using this code to set the cores: options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores()) rstan_options(auto_write = TRUE) 4.2 Poisson Regression Modelling We are going to fit a Poisson-type model on an outcome that contains discrete counts of households reporting to have been victims of burglary. These are counts of burglary events aggregated to street segments. Let us load the data into RStudio and call the object burglaryDataset. # Set your own directory using setwd() function # Load data into RStudio using read.csv(). The spreadsheet is stored in the object called &#39;burglaryData&#39; burglaryDataset &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Street Burglary Data in Nigeria.csv&quot;) names(burglaryDataset) 4.2.1 Selecting the appropriate Poisson model There are three different types of Poisson models: Standard Poisson regression Negative Binomial Poisson regression Zero-Inflated Poisson regression The implementation of one of these models are highly dependent on how the frequency distribution of the count response variable are displayed. If it resembles a normal curve - then use the standard Poisson version. Otherwise, use the Negative Binomial Poisson regression if there is any evidence of over-dispersion. When there’s an inflation of zero counts in the dataset, you will have to use the Zero-Inflated model to account for this problem. Let’s check the frequency distribution of the outcome variable Burglary which corresponds to the number of reported instances a property on a street was burgled. You can simply use a histogram to examine its distribution: # see lowest count min(burglaryDataset$burglary) # see highest count max(burglaryDataset$burglary) # visual distribution hist(burglaryDataset$burglary, breaks=20, xlim = c(0, 25), ylim = c(0, 600), xlab = &quot;Report number of burglaries on a street segment&quot;, ylab = &quot;Frequency&quot;, main = &quot;Distribution of Burglary counts&quot;) The plot show evidence of over-dispersion. It indicates that a high number of streets in this city have less frequency of burglaries, while a few number of streets have reported excess number of burglaries. Here, we consider using a Negative Binomial Poisson regression model over the standard and zero-inflated versions (i.e., scenario 1 and 3). Now, that we know the model type, let us estimate the over-dispersion parameter using the glm.nb() function. # Fit negative binomial regression null model nb_model &lt;- glm.nb(burglary ~ 1, data = burglaryDataset) # Extract theta theta &lt;- nb_model$theta theta [1] 0.3161472 The estimated over-dispersion parameter is 0.3161472, which is small, this suggests that residential burglaries exhibits substantial over-dispersion. We will use this value in our Bayesian model when we code it in Stan. Acknowledgements: Thanks to Fernando Rodriguez for pointing out that it is improper practice to fix the dispersion parameter in the model, and for advising that it is best practice to allow the model to estimate it instead. That part has been amended accordingly. Further thanks to Jacob Cohen for noting that the current approach to estimating the dispersion parameter should serve primarily as guidance only to help us understand the extent of dispersion in our data and inform the choice of a prior distribution accordingly. 4.2.2 Data preparation and set-up for Bayesian analysis in Stan Let begin with a model that only contains independent variables that are continuous measures i.e., distance and connectivity. We can prepare the dataset into list() object: stan_dataset_model1 &lt;- list(N = nrow(burglaryDataset), burg = burglaryDataset$burglary, dist = burglaryDataset$distance, conn = burglaryDataset$connectivity, offset = log(burglaryDataset$totalhouses) ) Important Notes: The list object stan_dataset_model1 from RStudio is passed into the Stan. N = nrow(burglaryDataset) we are extracting the number of observations present in the dataset. Note that this a smart way instead of hard coding the number. Note that here, N is 743, meaning there 743 street segments. burg = burglaryDataset$burglary: Here, we defined the outcome variable (i.e., counts of burglaries) as burg. dist = burglaryDataset$distance: Independent variable for distance. conn = burglaryDataset$connectivity: Independent variable for connectivity. off_set = log(burglaryDataset$totalhouses): Here, the off_set is calculated from taking the log-transform of the totalhouses, which is the denominators used for expressing the residential burglaries as a crime rate per capita. Let’s create our Stan script for running a Negative Binomial Poisson regression within a Bayesian framework. 4.2.3 Creating a script to run a Negative Binomial Poisson regression in Stan A typical Stan program for a regression consist of the following 5 blocks: Data Parameters Model Generated quantities The Data, Parameters and Model block must be specified for the regression to work. But there will be additional block that we will need to transform the resultant parameters (i.e., coefficients) into relative risk (RR) inside the Generated quantities block. Let’s start with the data block: FIRST STEP: We specify the total number of observations N as an integer, as well as the information we defined in our list object stan_dataset_model1 to be passed to Stan. This information is specified in the data block: data { int&lt;lower=0&gt; N; // declare the overall number of data points to be passed into model array[N] int&lt;lower=0&gt; burg; // define as an array and specify it as an integer for counts vector[N] dist; // continuous variable vector[N] conn; // continuous variable vector[N] off_set; // offset variable for the denominators (total households on a stree segment) } SECOND STEP: For the parameters block, here we will need to specify the name of the regression intercept alpha, which is baseline risk of residential burglaries, and the two coefficients i.e., beta[1] and beta[2] for our two independent variables dist and conn respectively. We will also create phi, a dispersion parameter, to mimic the behaviour of that shown in the histogram of Scenario 2 and the derived estimate of \\(\\theta\\) = 0.3161472 (see section 4.2.1) data { int&lt;lower=0&gt; N; // declare the overall number of data points to be passed into model array[N] int&lt;lower=0&gt; burg; // define as an array and specify it as an integer for counts vector[N] dist; // continuous variable vector[N] conn; // continuous variable vector[N] off_set; // offset variable for the denominators (total households on a stree segment) } parameters { real alpha; real&lt;lower=0&gt; phi; vector[2] beta; } THIRD STEP: We build our likelihood function and specify the priors for each parameter under the model block. For all parameters - the priors have been centred around 0, meaning that broadly, these variables have no effect on residential burglaries, and if any, these effects may range from ±1SD (so in risk terms 0.36 to 2.71). The regression model is neg_binomial_2_log(formula, Overdispersion): data { int&lt;lower=0&gt; N; // declare the overall number of data points to be passed into model array[N] int&lt;lower=0&gt; burg; // define as an array and specify it as an integer for counts vector[N] dist; // continuous variable vector[N] conn; // continuous variable vector[N] off_set; // offset variable for the denominators (total households on a stree segment) } parameters { real alpha; real&lt;lower=0&gt; phi; vector[2] beta; } model { // prior specification for our parameters alpha ~ normal(0, 1); beta[1] ~ normal(0, 1); beta[2] ~ normal(0, 1); phi ~ beta(2, 5) // likelihood function i.e., statistical model for (i in 1:N) { burg[i] ~ neg_binomial_2_log(alpha + beta[1]*dist[i] + beta[2]*conn[i] + offset[i], phi); } } LAST STEP: We instruct Stan to generated quantitites to calculate the relative risk ratio (RRs) by converting the estimated coefficients by using exp(). We ask it to calculate the log likelihood for model validation: data { int&lt;lower=0&gt; N; // declare the overall number of data points to be passed into model array[N] int&lt;lower=0&gt; burg; // define as an array and specify it as an integer for counts vector[N] dist; // continuous variable vector[N] conn; // continuous variable vector[N] off_set; // offset variable for the denominators (total households on a stree segment) } parameters { real alpha; real&lt;lower=0&gt; phi; vector[2] beta; } model { // prior specification for our parameters alpha ~ normal(0, 1); beta[1] ~ normal(0, 1); beta[2] ~ normal(0, 1); phi ~ beta(2, 5) // likelihood function i.e., statistical model for (i in 1:N) { burg[i] ~ neg_binomial_2_log(alpha + beta[1]*dist[i] + beta[2]*conn[i] + off_set[i], phi); } } generated quantities { // report crime risk ratios real baselineCrimeRR; vector[2] CrimeRR; baselineCrimeRR = exp(alpha); CrimeRR = exp(beta); // model validation and comparison vector[N] log_lik; for (i in 1:N) { log_lik[i] = neg_binomial_2_log_lpmf(burg[i] | alpha + beta[1]*dist[i] + beta[2]*conn[i] + off_set[i], phi); } } Save the stan script as Cont_Model_1.stan. 4.2.4 Compiling our Stan code in RStudio and Results Now, let us turn our attention to RStudio. Using the stan() to compile and obtain the posterior estimation of the overall risk and crime risk ratios (CRR) for the each independent variable: # the directory needs to be set to where you saved the dataset and Stan script crr.negbin.model1 = stan(&quot;Cont_Model_1.stan&quot;, data=stan_dataset_model1, iter=3000, chains=6, verbose = FALSE) We can print the results accordingly: # reports all results print(crr.negbin.model1, pars = c(&quot;alpha&quot;, &quot;beta&quot;, &quot;baselineCrimeRR&quot;, &quot;CrimeRR&quot;), probs = c(0.025, 0.975)) Output summary table Inference for Stan model: anon_model. 6 chains, each with iter=3000; warmup=1500; thin=1; post-warmup draws per chain=1500, total post-warmup draws=9000. mean se_mean sd 2.5% 97.5% n_eff Rhat alpha -2.16 0 0.13 -2.42 -1.91 3282 1 beta[1] 0.00 0 0.00 0.00 0.00 4237 1 beta[2] 0.06 0 0.02 0.02 0.11 3216 1 baselineCrimeRR 0.12 0 0.02 0.09 0.15 3225 1 CrimeRR[1] 1.00 0 0.00 1.00 1.00 4236 1 CrimeRR[2] 1.07 0 0.02 1.02 1.11 3215 1 Samples were drawn using NUTS(diag_e) at Fri Jan 24 02:30:42 2025. For each parameter, n_eff is a crude measure of effective sample size, and Rhat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat=1). Here is the messing part - interpretation. Before anything, note that alpha, beta[1] and beta[2] corresponds to the intercept, and coefficients for distance and connectivity, respectively. These are on the log-scale! The risk ratios from alpha, beta[1] and beta[2] which, in turn, corresponds to the intercept, and coefficients for distance and connectivity, respectively, are the baselineCrimeRR, CrimeRR[1] and CrimeRR[2]. For instance, the significant result is for connectivity, which shows for every unit increase in the number to street connections on a segment in the network, the risk of residential burglaries increase by 1.07 (7%), which is significant based on its 95% Credibility Interval (95 CrI: 1.02-1.11). We can compute exceedance probabilities i.e., that such risk concerning connectivity are greater than 1 (meaning there’s an excess risk): # Here, we can extract the simulated sample for CrimeRR[2] conn_draws &lt;- extract(crr.negbin.model1, &#39;CrimeRR[2]&#39;)[[1]] mean(conn_draws &gt; 1.00) [1] 0.9977778 This indicates a strong chance (99.7%) that streets with more connections to other street segments in the network will certainly increase the risk of residential burglaries. Lastly, we will assess the validity of our model using a test called Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation. The estimate from this test Expected Log Predictive Density (ELPD) quantifies how well a model performs and so higher values of ELPD indicates better predictive performance. While, it can be interpreted on its own, its primary value lies in model comparison rather than as an absolute measure. # extracting ELPD leave-one-out results from model with continuous variables only log_lik_with_cont &lt;- extract_log_lik(crr.negbin.model1, merge_chains = FALSE) r_eff_with_cont &lt;- relative_eff(log_lik_with_cont) loo_cont &lt;- loo(log_lik_with_cont, r_eff_with_cont, cores = 6) print(loo_cont) Computed from 9000 by 743 log-likelihood matrix.

We take note that the ELPD is -1022.1 4.2.5 Model with categorical variables The purpose of this section is to show: How to include categorical variables into the model Perform model comparisons Let’s include the following categorical variables: integq and choiceq into the regression. Each variable has four categories, we want to omit the first category as it represents the lowest exposure group, and use it a reference for the higher categories when we estimate their risk. # See table for categorical variables table(burglaryDataset$choiceq) table(burglaryDataset$integq) # Create dummy variables for choice burglaryDataset$choicecat2 &lt;- ifelse(burglaryDataset$choiceq == 2, 1, 0) burglaryDataset$choicecat3 &lt;- ifelse(burglaryDataset$choiceq == 3, 1, 0) burglaryDataset$choicecat4 &lt;- ifelse(burglaryDataset$choiceq == 4, 1, 0) # Create dummy variables for integration burglaryDataset$integ2 &lt;- ifelse(burglaryDataset$integq == 2, 1, 0) burglaryDataset$integ3 &lt;- ifelse(burglaryDataset$integq == 3, 1, 0) burglaryDataset$integ4 &lt;- ifelse(burglaryDataset$integq == 4, 1, 0) Let us expand the model to include independent variables that are both continuous and categorical measures i.e., distance and connectivity, choice and integration, and the new information into a list() object: stan_dataset_model2 &lt;- list(N = nrow(burglaryDataset), burg = burglaryDataset$burglary, dist = burglaryDataset$distance, conn = burglaryDataset$connectivity, chcat2 = burglaryDataset$choicecat2, chcat3 = burglaryDataset$choicecat3, chcat4 = burglaryDataset$choicecat4, intcat2 = burglaryDataset$integ2, intcat3 = burglaryDataset$integ3, intcat4 = burglaryDataset$integ4, off_set = log(burglaryDataset$totalhouses) ) The amended Stan code will look something as follows: data { int&lt;lower=0&gt; N; // declare the overall number of data points to be passed into model array[N] int&lt;lower=0&gt; burg; // define as an array and specify it as an integer for counts vector[N] dist; // continuous variable vector[N] conn; // continuous variable vector[N] chcat2; vector[N] chcat3; vector[N] chcat4; vector[N] intcat2; vector[N] intcat3; vector[N] intcat4; vector[N] off_set; // offset variable for the denominators (total households on a stree segment) } parameters { real alpha; real&lt;lower=0&gt; phi; vector[2] beta; vector[3] chcq; vector[3] intq; } model { // prior specification for our parameters alpha ~ normal(0, 1); beta ~ normal(0, 1); chcq ~ normal(0, 1); intq ~ normal(0, 1); phi ~ beta(2, 5) // likelihood function i.e., statistical model for (i in 1:N) { burg[i] ~ neg_binomial_2_log(alpha + beta[1]*dist[i] + beta[2]*conn[i] + chcq[1]*chcat2[i] + chcq[2]*chcat3[i] + chcq[3]*chcat4[i] + intq[1]*intcat2[i] + intq[2]*intcat3[i] + intq[3]*intcat4[i] + off_set[i], phi); } } generated quantities { // report crime risk ratios real baselineCrimeRR; vector[2] betaRR; vector[3] chcqRR; vector[3] intqRR; baselineCrimeRR = exp(alpha); betaRR = exp(beta); chcqRR = exp(chcq); intqRR = exp(intq); // model validation and comparison vector[N] log_lik; for (i in 1:N) { log_lik[i] = neg_binomial_2_log_lpmf(burg[i] | alpha + beta[1]*dist[i] + beta[2]*conn[i] + chcq[1]*chcat2[i] + chcq[2]*chcat3[i] + chcq[3]*chcat4[i] + intq[1]*intcat2[i] + intq[2]*intcat3[i] + intq[3]*intcat4[i] + off_set[i], phi); } } Please save the Stan script as Cat_Model_2.stan. We can use the stan() to compile the updated code to obtain the posterior estimation accordingly: # the directory needs to be set to where you saved the dataset and Stan script crr.negbin.model2 = stan(&quot;Cat_Model_2.stan&quot;, data=stan_dataset_model2, iter=3000, chains=6, verbose = FALSE) We can print the results accordingly: # reports all results print(crr.negbin.model2, pars = c(&quot;baselineCrimeRR&quot;, &quot;betaRR&quot;, &quot;chcqRR&quot;, &quot;intqRR&quot;), probs = c(0.025, 0.975)) Output summary table Inference for Stan model: anon_model. 6 chains, each with iter=3000; warmup=1500; thin=1; post-warmup draws per chain=1500, total post-warmup draws=9000. mean se_mean sd 2.5% 97.5% n_eff Rhat baselineCrimeRR 0.13 0 0.03 0.09 0.20 4190 1 betaRR[1] 1.00 0 0.00 1.00 1.00 11128 1 betaRR[2] 1.08 0 0.03 1.03 1.14 5524 1 chcqRR[1] 0.95 0 0.21 0.60 1.44 4692 1 chcqRR[2] 0.94 0 0.23 0.57 1.46 4593 1 chcqRR[3] 0.86 0 0.29 0.44 1.55 4266 1 intqRR[1] 0.94 0 0.20 0.61 1.39 5311 1 intqRR[2] 0.84 0 0.18 0.54 1.25 5119 1 intqRR[3] 0.81 0 0.19 0.49 1.24 5302 1 Samples were drawn using NUTS(diag_e) at Fri Jan 24 03:34:39 2025. For each parameter, n_eff is a crude measure of effective sample size, and Rhat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat=1). We can compare this model against the previous one to see which one highest ELPD value for better predictive performance. # extracting ELPD leave-one-out results from model with both continuous and categorical variables log_lik_with_cat &lt;- extract_log_lik(crr.negbin.model2, merge_chains = FALSE) r_eff_with_cat &lt;- relative_eff(log_lik_with_cat) loo_cat &lt;- loo(log_lik_with_cat, r_eff_with_cat, cores = 6) print(loo_cat) Computed from 9000 by 743 log-likelihood matrix.

All Pareto k estimates are good (k &lt; 0.7). See help(&#39;pareto-k-diagnostic&#39;) for details. This first model’s ELPD was -1022.1, and full model’s show -1026.7. Based on this result, it is clear that the first model is better in terms of predictive performance since its ELPD is higher (i.e., -1022.1 vs -1026.7). So its best to stick with the first model, unless there is a strong theoretical reason to use second model (i.e., accounting for confounding). 4.3 Tasks 4.3.1 Task 1 - Obesity and Fastfoods in London Accessibility to junk food restaurants in young adolescents especially after school hours is a growing cause for concern. Especially, now that many young adults have a sedentary lifestyle; hence obesity rates among this population is increasing in the UK. Try this problem in Stan: Use the dataset Obesity and Fastfoods in MSOAs data.csv to determine the links between prevalence of obesity in high school students and density of fast food (cheap) restaurant and deprivation in MSOAs in London. Implement a Bayesian GLM using Stan code. Variable names: SEQID: ID number for row MSOA11CD: Unique identifier for MSOA area MSOA11NM: Name of the MSOA area OBESE: Number of child identified as obese in MSOA in London TOTAL: Total number of children surveyed for BMI measurements IMDMSOA: Area-level socioeconomic deprivation score (higher scores means higher deprivation and vice versa) RESTCAT: Categorical variable for classifying an MSOA in terms of density of junk/cheap fast food outlets restaurants: 1 = 1 to 10, 2= 11 to 25, 3= 26 to 50 and 4= 51 to 300. HINT: You might want to consider using the following functions: binomial_logit() or binomial() in the model block and reporting the odd ratios using the generated quantities block.
