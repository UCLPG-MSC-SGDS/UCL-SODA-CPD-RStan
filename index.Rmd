[**UCL Social Data Institute (SODA)**](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/social-data/home/social-data-institute) is hosting a five-day course on Bayesian inference. The aim is to introduce academics and professional data analysts to the basics of Bayesian inference using RStudio and Stan. The course atmosphere will be extremely friendly and supportive, with the goal of teaching the fundamentals of Bayesian inference in Stan to participants from diverse backgrounds—including industry and research fields such as population health, social sciences, disaster-risk reduction, and many more.

By the end of the workshop, the you should be able to: 

- Acquire the foundation and advanced knowledge on key principles of statistical modelling within a Bayesian framework; 
- Be able to perform inferential statistics on spatial and non-spatial data to carry out hypothesis testing for evidence-based research using the diverse types of regression-based models from a Bayesian framework; 
- Be able to perform spatial risk prediction for areal data as well as quantify levels of uncertainty using exceedance probabilities; 
- Acquire new programming language skills such as Stan (interfaced with RStudio).
